# BBCodeEditor
This package renders a simple page that enables bbcode edit and preview. 
* Toolbars and preview are implemented using [jQuery MarkItUp](http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/)
* This editor applied two bbcode parsers ([jBBCode](http://jbbcode.com/) and [MarkItUp BBCode Parser](http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/downloads/)) to complementarily support bbcode functions such like list and nested tags.
* Please access to index.html using server where php could be resolved, otherwise the editor preview would not work.
* To test the page locally, please locate to the path of the package in the terminal, and execute '$ php -S localhost:8000' to make it a local server, then in the webbrowser "https://localhost:8000/index.html" should access to the page.
